# Neetechs Arabic AI — Language Intelligence from the Root

> 🚀 Build smarter. Tokenize faster. Understand deeper. In Arabic — and beyond.

---

## 🌍 Why Neetechs?

Most AI systems treat Arabic like an afterthought — breaking its rich morphology into meaningless chunks.

**Neetechs Arabic AI flips that.**

We start from the root (literally) — using Arabic’s powerful grammar and root-pattern system to deliver:

- 🧠 Smarter tokenization
- ⚡️ Faster model performance
- 🔍 Cleaner linguistic structure
- 📉 Smaller vocab size = less compute
- 💬 Natural grammar-aware generation

Whether you're Arabic-speaking or not — this is what efficient language modeling *should* look like.

## 🧠 What Makes It Different?

| Feature                   | English AI  | Neetechs Arabic AI           |
|--------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Word-based tokenization  | ✅ Basic     | ❌ Never — we go by roots      |
| Grammar awareness        | ❌ Weak      | ✅ Full syntactic control      |
| Diacritic handling       | ❌ Lost      | ✅ Reconstructed intelligently |
| Morphology compression   | ❌ Redundant | ✅ Token-efficient             |
| Root-pattern extraction  | ❌ Missing   | ✅ Native                      |

## 🛠️ Features

- 🧩 **Root & Pattern Tokenizer** — breaks Arabic into its core units
- 🔍 **Morphology-aware segmentation**
- ✍️ **Grammar Correction** — built on syntactic truth, not statistical guesses
- ḥ **Tashkīl Restoration** — adds missing diacritics using context + structure
- ⚙️ **Mini Language Model** — trained on Arabic morphology instead of raw text
- 🌐 **Foreign-Developer Friendly** — English comments, docs, and modular design

---

## 💡 Use Cases

```python
from neetechs_tokenizer import tokenize, get_root, restore_diacritics

tokenize("استكتب المعلم الطالب الدرس") 
# → ['است', 'كتب', 'ال', 'معلم', 'ال', 'طالب', 'الدرس']

get_root("مكتوب")  
# → 'كتب'

restore_diacritics("احب الذكاء الاصطناعي")  
# → "أُحِبُّ الذَّكَاءَ الِاصْطِنَاعِيَّ"
```

---

## 👥 Who Should Use This?

- 💬 Language AI devs tired of bloated English models
- 📚 Arabic learners & linguists
- 🕌 Qur'anic/Nahwu/NLP researchers
- 🧪 ML researchers looking for compressed, structured, root-based modeling
- ⚡️ Anyone who wants **less token bloat and faster inference**

---

## 🌐 International Ready

Everything is documented in **English**, with **modular API design**, so even non-Arabic devs can integrate it into their pipelines.

Want to train a custom model in a Semitic, root-based language?  
Use Neetechs as your blueprint.

---

## 🔮 The Vision

**Neetechs Arabic AI** isn't just an Arabic tool.

It's the start of a new class of AI systems —  
built from the **structure** of language,  
not the laziness of surface-level text.
